# CNN2-Car-Brand-Prediction
Car Brand Prediction using transfer learning technique RESNET50
CNN project ‘Car Brand Prediction’ was implemented. Transfer Learning 
Technique ResNet50 was used for image classification to predict car brand. Image 
prediction took place using Keras library. Image Augmentation is one of the image 
preprocessing steps. Performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics.
